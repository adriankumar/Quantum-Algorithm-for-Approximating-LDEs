# Quantum-Algorithm-for-Approximating-LDEs


Notebook Implementation of a quantum algorithm proposed by [Tao Xin](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04553) for approximating Linear Differential Equations for Quantum Software & Programming (2025) Assignment-3 using `QMod` language

You will need to:
* have a [Classiq](https://www.classiq.io/) account 
* Either set up a classiq environment locally through pip install or upload this notebook to [Classiq Studio](https://platform.classiq.io/) and run (recommended) 

~otherwise, read through results from current upload

**Note: Too see interactive plots for bound experiments and classical solver comparison; upload to classiq studio and it should appear, otherwise re-run the code**
